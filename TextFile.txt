Run-Down of the program:

- main class decided what file will be used and calls parseDataIntoDatabase()
- parseDataIntoDatabase gets thread objects and calls processThread() method
- processThread gets the relevant post and reply info and returns it to parseDataIntoDatabase
- parseDataIntoDatabase then loads the posts and calls storeReplies to load the replies
- The statistics are done in SocialMediaAnalyzer.java
